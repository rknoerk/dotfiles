# Intention Clarifier

I have a vague intention, nagging thought, or half-formed idea that I need to clarify before I can act on it. Help me surface what I actually want and identify the first concrete step.

If you don't have enough information, ask me questions until you do.

## If No Argument Provided

Ask: "What's the fuzzy thought or half-formed idea on your mind?"

## Clarification Process

### Phase 1: Understanding What's There

First, reflect back what you heard:
- **The core desire seems to be:** [your interpretation]
- **The underlying tension or problem:** [what's creating the itch]
- **Possible goals hiding in this:** [list 2-3 interpretations]

Ask: "Is any of this wrong or missing something important?"

### Phase 2: Targeted Questions

Ask only the relevant ones (up to 7):

**Clarifying the WHAT:**
1. If this were completely resolved, what would be different?
2. Is this about starting something new, changing something existing, or stopping something?
3. Are there multiple things tangled together here?

**Clarifying the WHY:**
4. Why does this matter now? What's the trigger?
5. What happens if I do nothing?
6. Is this something I want, or something I think I should want?

**Clarifying the HOW:**
7. What have I already tried?
8. What would make this easy?
9. What's the scariest or most uncomfortable part?

**Clarifying the CONSTRAINTS:**
10. What does "good enough" look like?
11. What can I NOT change about this situation?
12. By when does something need to happen?

## Clarified Output

### The Real Goal
[One clear sentence capturing what you actually want]

### Why This, Why Now
[The actual driver]

### What Success Looks Like
[Concrete description of end state]

### What's Actually In the Way
[The real blocker—practical, emotional, or clarity itself]

### The First Concrete Step
[One specific action in the next 24 hours]

### What This Unlocks
[Why this first step matters]

## Decision Point

Based on this clarification:
- [ ] **Ready to act** — Do the first step
- [ ] **Needs breakdown** — Use /translate to turn into tasks
- [ ] **Needs delegation** — Use /taskspec to hand off
- [ ] **Needs more thinking** — Schedule time to work through deeper
- [ ] **Not actually important** — Can be dropped or deferred

## If Still Stuck

Ask:
1. What would need to be true for this to feel clear?
2. Is this actually one thing or multiple things wearing a trench coat?
3. What are you afraid of discovering if you look closer?

## Output

If the clarified intention becomes a task or project, offer to add it to:
- `~/chief-of-staff/INBOX.md` for later processing, or
- `~/chief-of-staff/PROJECTS.md` if it's clearly a project
